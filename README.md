# LASER Dynamics Simulation
The included script is a simplified LASER dynamics simulation written in Matlab as an assignment for the course of "Dispositivi per la Trasmissione dell'Informazione" at Politecnico di Milano. For this project I collaborated with Simone Giamp√†.

The algorithm is based on the Cellular Automata Model, and was heavily inspired by "Laser Dynamics Modelling and Simulation: An Application of Dynamic Load Balancing of Parallel Cellular Automata", a paper available at https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226637251_Laser_Dynamics_Modelling_and_Simulation_An_Application_of_Dynamic_Load_Balancing_of_Parallel_Cellular_Automata .
