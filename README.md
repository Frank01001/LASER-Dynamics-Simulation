# LASER Dynamics Simulation
The included script is a simplified LASER dynamics simulation written in Matlab as an assignment for the course of "Dispositivi per la Trasmissione dell'Informazione" at Politecnico di Milano.

The algorithm is based on the Cellular Automata Model, and was heavily inspired by "Laser Dynamics Modelling and Simulation: An Application of Dynamic Load Balancing of Parallel Cellular Automata", a paper available at https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226637251_Laser_Dynamics_Modelling_and_Simulation_An_Application_of_Dynamic_Load_Balancing_of_Parallel_Cellular_Automata.

The repository contains both a Matlab implementation and a Java implementation. The former was created later in the project development in order to increase performance.
